## Person speaking (second level heading)

> Painting Traces is part of my Current exhibition Turas.

> Using memory as a tool to my art, I have been exploring and researching
narrative of memory, traces of past history, and the layers and surfaces
that remain left behind, exploring lines of direction, forms and colours.

> Painted from traces of paint from a larger work that I was working on in my
studio.

> Paint physically left behind on brushes and on tape and rags, placed on a
new canvas to create something new and exciting.

> The use of gesture sweeping brush strokes, saturated colours, subtracting
paint with turpentine to interchange with the traces of marks and colours
left behind.

> This was an experimentation of methods and materials to manipulate the
outcome to differ from the original painting from which my materials
originated.
