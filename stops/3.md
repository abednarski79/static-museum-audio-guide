## Christine Carey

> A painting to represent the tool The Mill Knife, that was used by the
workforce in Semperit Tyre Factory in the outer suburbs of Dublin City.

> The curvature forms in my painting  is influenced by an interview I
completed with a past employee from Semperit Tyre factory, Chris Dunne.

> The Mill knife  had a bladed curved  sharp edge and was held by a wooden
handle that was a size to fit your fist. The carbon mixture was extremely
hot and it would be cut at an angle by the sharp curved blade.

> Work wear for the Mill Man, was Blue overalls, a peaked cap and gloves to
be  worn at all times.
