## Christine Carey

> My exhibition "TURAS" is from a series of photographs of a large empty
factory that once housed a workforce, "Semperit" tyre factory in
Ballyfermot.

> The aluminum sculpture Turas is a commemoration in three dimensional form,
a connection of the past to the present.

> Torn fabrics once covered the body of the remains, bellowing in the winds,
revealing the reflective surface of steel beneath. It was a portrait in
solid form. it portrayed a visual for me of a life and of memories once
held there.

> The derelict site is now an isolated building with an energy and identity
still present. Holding traces of narratives that are interwoven and
embedded into the fabric of the site.

> My work attempts to cross over and connect my architectural imagery with
the ageing  of memory, a movement and link between time and space.
