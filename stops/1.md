## Christine Carey

> Through my art practice I have been researching and recording narrative of memory, traces that lie within abandoned derelict sites, liminal spaces.
> A discovery of layers of narrative and of history that the site has absorbed over its lifetime.
> As an artist I attempt to translate and record my interpretation of a narrative, a physical image in paint, a commemoration in a solid three dimensional form of aluminum through sculpture.
